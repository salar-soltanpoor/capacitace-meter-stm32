# capacitace-meter-stm32
capacitace meter using STM32F103RE using register level programming AKA bare metal for STM32F103RE 
i used charging method for measuring capacitance. 
this is the circuit i used

the values that i got were close to the real capacitance that i measured using a victor 88c multimeter. 
any help in improving the code is appreciated.
